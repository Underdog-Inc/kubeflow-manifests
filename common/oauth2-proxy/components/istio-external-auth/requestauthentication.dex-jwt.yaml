spec:
  # we only apply to the ingress-gateway because:
  #  - there is no need to verify the same tokens at each sidecar
  #  - having no selector will apply to the RequestAuthentication to ALL
  #    Pods in the mesh, even ones which are not part of Kubeflow
  #  - some Kubeflow services accept direct connections with Kubernetes JWTs,
  #    and we don't want to require that users configure Istio to verify Kubernetes JWTs
  #    as there is no method to do this which works on all distributions.
